0,7 Summers,Morgan Wallen,Country,"Yeah, you used to talk about Getting even further South Somewhere where the summer lasted all year 'round Probably got a big ol' diamond on your hand right now Maybe a baby or a couple by now Long driveway to a big white house  But I wonder when you're drinking if you Find yourself thinking about That boy from East Tennessee And I know we both knew better But we still said forever And that was seven summers Of Coke and Southern Comfort Were we dumb or just younger, who knows? Back then, you used to love the river And sippin' on a sixer with me Does it ever make you sad to know That was seven summers ago?  Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh  Yeah, I bet your daddy's so proud Of how his little girl turned out Think she dodged a bullet Of a good old boy like me 'Cause I still Go drinkin', same friends on Friday Bought a few acres, couple roads off the highway Guess you never saw things my way anyway But I wonder when you're drinking if you Find yourself thinking about That boy from East Tennessee And I know we both knew better But we still said forever And that was seven summers Of Coke and Southern Comfort Were we dumb or just younger, who knows? Back then, you used to love the river And sippin' on a sixer with me Does it ever make you sad to know That was seven summers ago?  Ooh Seven summers ago (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh) Seven summers ago (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)  Yeah, I wonder when you're drinking if you Find yourself thinking about That boy from East Tennessee And I know we both knew better But we still said forever And that was seven summers Of Coke and Southern Comfort Were we dumb or just younger, who knows?

70,Forgetting Is the Hardest Part,Kane Brown,Country,There’s no doubt it was always you From that first time I walked you home from school Until you stole my heart underneath that August moon It was always you… it was always you Now it hurts to see your pretty smile fade I’ve got a front row seat to watch you drift away And I know there’s nothing left for us to say But it’s okay… it’s okay  There’s no getting over you I tried to sugarcoat the truth But the missing you is tearing me apart Every kiss that I let slip away Every minute every single day The memories make it easy to break a heart But forgetting… forgetting is the hardest part  Sometimes I sit here feeling like a ghost Its that emptiness I think that hurts the most But a piece of me still holds a little hope I should just let go… but I can’t let go  There’s no getting over you I tried to sugarcoat the truth But the missing you is tearing me apart Every kiss that I let slip away Every minute every single day The memories make it easy to break a heart But forgetting… forgetting is the hardest part It’s time to pull myself together And put these pieces back wherever Maybe one day I’ll find love again… again  There’s no getting over you I've tried to sugarcoat the truth A million times but I'm still torn apart Every kiss that I let slip away Every minute every single day The memories make it easy to break a heart But forgetting… forgetting is the hardest part2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy

698,Sirens,Lee Brice,Country,"I just remember her tan legs standing on the side of the road Honda with the hood up covered in smoke Thumb in the air with somewhere to go in a hurry She didn't say a thing, she just jumped inside Stuck a gun to my chest and told me to drive I was scared but she was beautiful, like a movie She kept looking back like something was coming Said we ain't slowing down, ain't stopping for nothing My truck was shaking, my blood was pumping But she was laughing I about hit the brakes when we came around the corner A mile of blue lights, guns aimed and pointed Whatever she had is what they wanted And it's all a little fuzzy after that  All I remember is sirens Blue lights flashing and driving Dirt lane passing and flying Tearing through the red lights Blowing through the stop signs All I remember is sirens Ringing from the gun shots firing One curve away from dying Yeah, all I remember is... Sirens The man on the radio reported the chase And all about the beauty How she cleaned out the bank She was armed and dangerous And almost got away but they found her She was cussing the choppers They were swirling around Reloading her revolver every couple-a-rounds Shot off a couple shots But they wouldn't back down  All I remember is sirens Blue lights flashing and driving Dirt lane passing and flying Tearing through the red lights Blowing through the stop signs All I remember is sirens Ringing from the gun shots firing One curve away from dying Really, all I remember is... Sirens Yeahhh sirens  We were all out to road and I knew she could tell Because she leaned across my lap and buckled my belt And kissed me on the cheek and said ""Thanks for the help, and hold on boy."" Well she yanked the wheel and I held my breath We flipped so many times we should have been dead And that's all I got And I just woke up here and I said All I remember is sirens Blue lights flashing and driving Dirt lane passing and flying Tearing through the red lights Blowing through the stop signs All I remember is sirens Blue lights flashing and smiling One curve away from dying All I remember is... Sirens Sirens...  And her blue eyes flashing And those long legs standing on the side of the road Her Honda with the hood up covered in smoke Thumb in the air, somewhere to go in a hurry1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

781,"Quiet, Heavy Dreams",Zach Bryan,Country,"Mighty long shifts are for working Heavy dreams are for toting around Let's pretend there's a place to go Where I can lay this hacksaw down And I've been trying all my damnedest To get where a kind woman lies Ten more hours to a twelve long shift 'Til these woods turn to her eyes The timber cuts so cleanly Monday morning when the blades are sharp I get a love song stuck in my head And cut sequoia 'til it's dark  If every hour's fourteen dollars or a chance closer to her Then I'm not just a working mule, I'm the finest of the herd And I don't know who she is or if she might exist But if she does I swear to love I'm destined for that kiss  How's a man get so homesick For a face he's never seen? I close my eyes while sweating And think of boys I could've been But I know that it’s not over 'Cause I can feel her here somewhere Through these trees and melodies That I’m belting to the air If every hour's fourteen dollars or a chance closer to it The man I thought I'd be when I was just a kid So I'll just saw away and let them all fall to the ground Hope to heaven someone hears me Even though no one's around  Mighty long shifts are for working Quiet dreams are for toting around Let's pretend there's a place to go Where I can lay this hacksaw downEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Is it lost in the emptiness of apathy? Should I fight for it like war? Should I nail it down to boards? Or do I live in a love I'm dying for?  And how do I make you fall in love with me? And how do I let you know I care? And how would I say that the man you're laying with Is not the man that should be laying there?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
